Reflective Report
=================

Although I already knew most Python basics, learning an entirely new module
is always kind of challenging. Panda3D is a great tool for creating a three-dimensional
animation and I really enjoyed learning it. I now know how to create 'actors' or controllable entities within
a virtual environment which I can choose the background of. I can change how the actor appears, in terms of its 
dimensions and its color, and I know how to create other things besides pandas.

I also learned how to add music to the environment, which can be pretty good for setting the overall mood and 
intended atmosphere for the animation. I found this to be one of the easier tasks as it only took a quick google search to learn
what command I needed to use.

The part that I struggled with the most was the implementation of multiple actors that do the same things. It took a while to find what
I was looking for online and in the Panda3D documentation. However, upon finally finding a solution, I was able to learn about instancing and then
implement this into my code. I believe that I understand it well enough now to be able to repeat it.
There may have been a simpler method that others used (when I asked my peers they didn't seem to know what instancing was), so I may have ended up
overcomplicating my searches. I believe that learning how other people managed to complete the same task as me is important too; in the future I 
will try to find out what they did and compare my method with theirs to see which one would have been more efficient.

Using Git and GitHub was completely new to me. However, having learned both how to use it and of its importance,
I am ready and happy to use them again.

The use of committing was incredibly helpful as I could just roll back to previous
versions every time I made an error, which previously I did not know was possible - in the past I would either spam Control+Z
or just try to remember what the code originally said and retype it all.

I also learned about SSH keys. Originally, I found them to be extremely inconvenient, mostly because I did not understand how to use them - the initial setup took me nearly an hour
due to my own confusion. Conversely,
I now know that it takes less than 3 minutes when I actually know what I'm doing, and that I only have to do it again when I use a different device. Now that I know this, they feel a
lot more useful and I really appreciate how easy they make it to access my repositories from any device safely and securely.
